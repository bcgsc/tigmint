# Tigmint Installation Test

This test is provided for the purpose of testing your Tigmint installation.

The script expects Tigmint to be in your PATH, and that all of the dependencies are installed (see main README for details). 

Once you have all of the software in your path, go to the test_installation directory and execute:

```sh
./run_tigmint_demo.sh
```

This test will run both tigmint and tigmint-long. Once the demo is complete, compare your output files to those in the "expected_outputs" directory to ensure that the run was successful.
